# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 27th May 2025

## 1. Introduction

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how this app (the “App”) collects, uses, stores, and protects your information, particularly in connection with its integration with third-party services such as the Glowmarkt API.

## 2. Use of Third-Party Services

The App interacts with third-party services, specifically the Glowmarkt API, to provide its core functionality.

- **Third-Party Data Handling:** Any information you provide to Glowmarkt, or any data processed by Glowmarkt as a result of your use of this App, is governed by Glowmarkt’s privacy policy.
- **No Control Over Third Parties:** We do not control, and are not responsible for, the privacy practices of Glowmarkt or any other third-party services.
- **Learn More:** For details on how Glowmarkt handles your data, please review their Privacy Policy: [https://glowmarkt.com/privacy-policy](https://glowmarkt.com/privacy-policy).

## 3. Glowmarkt Access & Credential Management

- **Credentials Storage:** To enable integration, the App requires your Glowmarkt API username and password. These credentials are stored securely on your device using the system keychain or equivalent secure storage.
- **Usage:** Credentials are used solely to authenticate with the Glowmarkt API. They are never shared with third parties or transmitted elsewhere.
- **Managing Credentials:** You may update or change your Glowmarkt credentials at any time via the App’s settings. Updating credentials replaces the previous credentials in secure storage.
- **Data Deletion:** You can remove all stored credentials and downloaded data from your device by using the factory reset function under Data Management in the App’s settings. This action is irreversible and will delete all your data, including credentials.
- **Re-Authentication:** After a factory reset, you must re-enter your credentials to continue using the App and to re-download your data from the Glowmarkt API.

## 4. Local Data Storage & Data Removal

- **Data Location:** All energy usage and tariff data downloaded by the App is stored locally on your device only.
- **No Data Sharing:** The App does not transmit your data to any other devices or third parties.
- **User Responsibility:** You are responsible for managing data stored on your device. We recommend using the App only on private, user-protected devices.
- **Multiple Devices:** If you use the App on multiple devices, your data is stored separately on each device.
- **Data Deletion:** You can delete all downloaded data at any time using the 'Clear All Data' or 'Factory Reset' options under 'Data Management' in the settings.
- **Important:** To ensure that no personal data or credentials remain on your device after you stop using the App, **please perform a factory reset within the App before uninstalling it**. If you remove the App without performing a factory reset, your data will remain on the device until manually deleted.

## 5. Analytics and Tracking

- **No Analytics:** The App does not use any analytics, tracking, or advertising technologies outside of its integration with the Glowmarkt API.

## 6. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information, including the use of secure storage for credentials. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. We recommend protecting your device with a password or biometric lock.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App and/or on our website. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of those changes.
